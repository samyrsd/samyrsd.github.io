This is how I usually do when I come across a new concept.

# 1. Be genuinely curious

- You cannot eat, you cannot sleep, until you find the answer.
- No matter how hard or how long it is to get the answer, instead of finding excuses, you will always always always try to figure out ways to that answer.
- Otherwise, maybe that's not something you're interested in.

# 2. Ask why it exists

- Some examples:
  - Why does watch exist? To tell time.
  - Why does bank exist? Keep money. Lend money. Invest money.
  - Why does government exist? Individuals act on self-interest. The business of other people or public space is not their concern. Government exist to regulate individuals interest to make sure no one is cheating and everyone is happy.
- Sometimes if you find it hard and time consuming to find the answer to why it exists, see point number 1.

# 3. Knowledge tree

- Figure out what is the smaller things needed to understand the new concept. Break that smaller things into smaller things into smaller things.

## When this does not work

- This is what works for me. Doesn't mean it works for everyone.
- Works mostly on human construct. Not really work on nature. Ex: Answering why the big bang exist will cause massive hair loss and lead to the founding of new religion :D
