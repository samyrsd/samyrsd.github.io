I am grateful to anyone that, with their best intention, give many good advices. Some of them changed my life, but some of them wasted years of my life. This writings aim to help protecting you from the latter one.

The reason that we seek for advice is we are in a process of making decisions.

Advice is a piece of insight that people formulate through out their experience during a certain time, a certain location, and a certain context, and they think it is good for you. The information might include the things you should or shouldn't do.

## Advice is subjective.

If they are businessmen, they will advice you to optimize your life for money. If they are professors, they will advise you to optimize your life for knowledge. Things that work for them does not necessarily works for you. They have no idea what you are capable of, what is in your head, what your belief, what your passion is. Treating those advices as instruction is very dangerous. Because it can knock down your self-esteem and belief which would have been in fact the thing that you needed.

## The generation of advice consumption

People giving advice everywhere. Social media are full of people who are giving advice. Some are super useful, and some are just a way to get you to watch and temporarily feel good about yourself with artificial sense of achievement.

## Lack of skin in the game

Be thankful to people giving advice. But, be very careful when the people giving advice is not around to experience the consequence of it. What's even more confusing is when people give you advice just because they think that it is cool for you to do, without any evidence of it will work, claim credit when they are right, and bear no connection when you fail.

## Confirmation bias

You still need someone to confirm your belief. You still need someone to tell you that it is right. So you go online and find the video that confirm your beliefs. And lo and behold, the "advice" you believe that it is the one.

"Ok. Advice sucks. Now I don't know what to do and I need help. So what now? Tell me! Huh? Huh!? Don't act all that smart at bring out the problem without solution!"

At this point, some people might think that I sound like a cynic or a narcissist, spreading negativity while they are enjoying "advice" from influencers and motivational videos.

## Tell stories, not advice

Rather than listening to advice, I am usually more interested in listening to their stories, their obstacles and their approach to overcome them. Tell me what you did and didn't do, and why? What would you have done differently? What did you learn?

## Reasoning from first principle

What I usually do is to collect the information by following curiosity. Break the problem down into small components. Figure out what is the right way to solve each of them. Connect the dot. Then formulate a solution that works for me in my current context, my current time and my current location.

Don't be lazy and expect the answer is there without putting in the work.

## Reasoning vs external influence

Assuming you have all the information, it is still hard to reason when you are affected by anxiety, social pressure, group think, and other external influences. You believe that it is right to do it for yourself, but doesn't feel right to the group. These nudges cloud your reasonings and make you a worse decision maker. Remember that the only person who has all the information is YOU.

You don't need "5 books you should that change your life" advice video. You just go and read the one you're interested in. Think for yourself and act on it.

Yes.
