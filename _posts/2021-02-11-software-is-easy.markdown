title: "Software is easy"
---

Building software is hard. Anyone say it is easy, either they are Gods or clickbait. Dependency confusion, code miscommunication, exponential decrease in productivity as the team size increase, smelly legacy code, "but it runs on my machine", ... (+inf) are what people spends millions of $ and years to make software work reliably. I used to hear, "software engineering is all about managing complexity." and I dig it.

You might ask, what about Flappy Bird? No. I'm talking about software that requires 20+ ppl to work on. If Flappy Bird were made by 100 engineers, I'm sure that development were going to be full of tear and sorrow as well.

Code you write today will not last forever. Unlike music, piece of art or movies, software consistently require maintainence and evolve as the ecosystem change.

If you are a company whose competitive advantage is your tech stack, you are in grave risk if you buy off-the-shelf software or oursourcing. You should be fine if you're selling shoes.
